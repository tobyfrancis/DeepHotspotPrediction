# DeepHotspotPrediction

This is a repository of tools and notebooks which showcase deep learning for hotspot prediction.
The main insights gained from such an approach are in the corresponding analysis of how and what the networks learns.

## ToDo:
1. A notebook showcasing a simple 2D Hypercolumn/PixelNet approach to the hotspot-grain and Von Mises stress prediction tasks.
2. A notebook showcasing the analysis of these networks - visualization of principle components and tSNE of the feature maps.
3. Wrapping these networks into library code for general usage.
4. A notebook showcasing the extension from 2D into 3D.
5. A notebook showcasing the analysis of the 3D networks, and a comparison to what the 2D networks learned.
6. Wrapping these networks into library code for general usage.

### Option ToDos:
1. Bayesian Convolutional Segmentation Networks with Edward (difficult step - defining convolution in Edward).
2. Uncertainty measurement with Monte Carlo Dropout Sampling: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02680
